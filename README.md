# Magnetic Peak Fitting Directly from .spec File

This repository contains Python code for analyzing X-ray diffraction (XRD) data directly from `.spec` files. The code extracts data for specific scans, processes it, and visualizes the results.

## Features
- Load and parse `.spec` files.
- Extract `theta` and intensity data from specified scans.
- Plot intensity as a function of `theta` for a range of scans.
- Support for multiple scans with a grid-based subplot layout.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chetanath/Magnetic-peak-fitting-directly-from-.spec-file-.git
   cd Magnetic-peak-fitting-directly-from-.spec-file-
